				- planning/ -> a folder containing all the files related to the early phase of the project. Usually this is the first folder I create, and here I store all the miscellaneous files (the notes/objectives/initial drafts) that I collect in the first weeks of a projects, when I still am not sure which programs to write.
				- bugs/ -> I plan to use [ditz](http://ditz.rubyforge.org/) to keep track of bugs and To-Dos, currently working with [trello](http://trello.com)
				- data/ -> folders containing the different data I need to use, soft-linked from ~/data
				- parameters/ -> ideally, I should have configuration files so if I want to run my analysis on other dataset, I only have to change the parameters here
				- src/ -> with all code
				- a Makefile to re-run all the analysis I wish
				- scripts/ with all the scripts
				- lib/ eventually, if I am reusing code from other projects
				- pipelines/ with all .mk (makefile) files

				- results/
					+ tables/ -> tabular-like results
					+ plots/ -> plots
					+ manuscript/ -> draft for the manuscript, final figures and data, etc..
					+ figures/
					+ tables/
					+ references/

				I use git for revision control, to get a log of all the changes I make to scripts and results.
